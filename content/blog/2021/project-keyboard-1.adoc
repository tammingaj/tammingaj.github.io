As a coder my keyboard is to me what [.line-through]#a cleaver is to a butcher# a pen is to a poet. Without it I would have
to resort to more physical labour to provide me an income, something that I want to prevent at all cost, slacker that I am.

So during my working life I have had some experiments with keyboards, especially during the periods when I had some more
problems with RSI like phenomena. Back in the nineties I bought me a link:https://twiddler.tekgear.com/index.html[Twiddler]
(version 1, with PS/2 cable) but using it was too difficult. Later I used various ergonomic keyboards, all of them with
the traditional layout consisting of a main part and a num pad, with cursor keys in between. Some years ago I started using the
mouse with my left hand, which to me is more logical because on that side you don't have the numpad in the way.

Lately I came across the link:https://waytools.com/[TextBlade] which is a small, portable bluetooth keyboard that is highly
configurable but, alas, unobtainable. This started me thinking about creating my own keyboard, based on a small microprocessor
like the arduino. So I started googling around, and surprise surprise there is a whole community of keyboard nerds that do
exactly that. Found huge flame wars about clicky versus non-clicky keys, the optimal spring force for the keys and how to
best create your own keycaps.

I also found many keyboard designs. Ranging from part lists with minimal instructions, to kits you have to solder together,
to complete keyboards ready to plug in. I chose option two. I am prepared to do some soldering but since I have virtually
no knowledge of electronics I need some instruction.

* split design
* configurable keymaps
* preferably wireless/bluetooth
* as small as possible
