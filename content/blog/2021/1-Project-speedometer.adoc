When I was sailing my link:../../trimaran.html[trimaran] the other day, it occurred to me that it would be nice to have
a better speed indicator.

Up to then I used a navigation app on my phone, but these things are not easy to read in direct
sunlight. The battery will also empty quite fast when you leave the screen on all the time.
I could of course have bought a navigation system, but cheapskate that I am I thought them too expensive. All I wanted was
to see at a glance how fast I was going. The phone suffices for navigation: once in a while have a look at it to see if
I am where I think I am, as far as I cannot see that by looking around. But when optimising for speed I need direct input.

So I drew up a list of requirements. I want to be able to read the speed in daylight. Also I want to know the maximum
speed of the trip, and the maximum speed over all. The trip-max should be resettable by pressing a button, and the all-time
max should be resettable too, but less easy. For both maximums I want to know date and time. As a last requirement the
device should be battery operated because I didn't want any power cables lying around.

I had a Teensy 2++ lying around from another project years ago that I never even started because I know nothing about electronics.
But seeing some people tinkering around on youtube I thought it might be worthwhile to give it a try anyway.
My eReader is perfectly readable in direct sunlight which had me wondering if there would be any smaller e-paper screens
that can be used by amateurs. It turned out there are. The Waveshare e-paper screens even have software for some Arduino
models available. I also found a GPS board that uses serial communication.

Well, that's that then. I identified the three main parts of the device: the Teensy 2++ processor board, a Waveshare e-paper display
and the ATGM336H GPS Module.
